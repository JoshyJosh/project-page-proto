== README

This is a refurbishing of my project site http://www.joshyjosh.si/ to include the Ruby on Rails framework.

The site works as a sort of project page and is currently only comprised of HTML, CSS and Javascript. It should house projects written in various programming languages.

<tt>Rails version: 4.2.3</tt>
